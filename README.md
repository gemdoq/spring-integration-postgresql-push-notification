# Spring Integration PostgreSQL Notification
PostgreSQL's `NOTIFY/LISTEN` feature with Spring Integration to implement a `SubscribableChannel` for notification-based communication. 
The implementation allows for lightweight, asynchronous messaging across different clients using database connections.

## Features
- Integration of PostgreSQL's `NOTIFY/LISTEN` mechanism with Spring Integration.
- Implementation of a custom `SubscribableChannel` for handling notifications.
- Example use case for processing BUY/SELL orders and maintaining a transaction summary.
- Scalable architecture with support for message transformation and asynchronous processing.

## Prerequisites
The following dependencies are required for this project:
- Spring Integration Core: Provides foundational support for message-driven architectures.
- PostgreSQL JDBC Driver: Enables communication with the PostgreSQL database.
